# Config  File Encryption And Decryption

## Introduction

In most production environments, sensitive configuration items such as passwords are required to be encrypted and cannot be stored in plain text, SeaTunnel provides a convenient one-stop solution for this.

## Design

## How to use

SeaTunnel comes with the function of base64 encryption and decryption, but it is not recommended for production use, it is recommended that users implement custom encryption and decryption logic. You can refer to this chapter [How to implement user-defined encryption and decryption](#How to implement user-defined encryption and decryption) get more details about it.

Next, I'll show how to quickly use SeaTunnel's own base64 encryption:
